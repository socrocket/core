===========

@section Introduction
This manual will try to give you all the necessary information you need to get the simulator running and provide you with the necessary documents to understand its inner workings and how to work with it.

You should start with the chapter @subpage requirements "Requirements" followed by @subpage install "Installation" and @subpage firstrun "Run Software" to get the "Hello World" example running.
