Dual Licensing Scheme {#license_com}
=====================

SoCRocket is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License
Version 3 and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated
directly with TU-Braunschweig, c3e. If you obtained SoCRocket under
the AGPL, then the AGPL applies to all loadable SoCRocket repositories
used on your system as well, except as defined below. The AGPL (version 3)
is included in this source tree in the file @ref license_agpl "LICENSE.AGPL.md".

This repository also includes various components that are not part of
SoCRocket itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directories
and its subdirectories. These components might be distributed under different
license than the AGPL version 3.

TU-BRaunschweig, c3e holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the SoCRocket repositories, and therefore can grant,
at its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or
organizations to create proprietary or Open Source (even if not AGPL)
repositories which may be linked with the portions of SoCRocket which
fall under our copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under
more flexible licenses than AGPL.

If you wish to use our code in other (A)GPL programs, don't worry --
there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
(A)GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for SoCRocket we
would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).

The 'SoCRocket' name and logos are owned by TU-Braunschweig, c3e,
and use of them is subject to our licensing policies. If you
wish to use these for purposes other than simple redistribution
of SoCRocket source code obtained from TU-BRaunschweig, c3e, you
should contact us to determine the necessary steps you must take.

If you have any questions regarding our licensing policy, please
